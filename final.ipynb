    "To import NBA season data, we need to go to a given NBA season and import the proper data. This includes the Per Game stats, Per Game Opponent stats, and the Advanced stats. On basketball-reference, you can easily press the share and export and click Get as CSV. Simply download the CSV and put into the proper file. If Per Game stats, put into `pg.csv`, if Per Game Opponent stats, put into `pgo.csv`, if Advanced stats, put into `adv.csv`. Note, when putting into the proper folder, put the year as the starting year of the NBA season. For example, the 2024-2025 season is stored in the `24` folder."
